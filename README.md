# CMAT
A simple tool for performing RREF on imaginary matrices on the TI84 Plus CE. 

# How to Install
Simply drag and drop `CMAT.8xp` onto your calculator in TI Connect. On newer calculators you may need to use
tools such as arTIfiCE to load the program, as it is written in C and is therefore blocked on newer versions of the 
firmware.

# Supporting
CMAT is new and hastily written, as I needed this for a circuits class; therefore, it may have bugs or other issues.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any problems, or submit a pull request. New features may be added in the future
depending on interest and need.
